# Hi, I'm Shane!

I'm a third year student at Simon Fraser University studying math and computer science.
I have strong interests in systems programming, algorithms, formal methods, kernel engineering, and mechanistic interpretability.
I am excited about working with others to build fault-tolerant software for large-scale deployment.
What motivates me is being able to help people live better lives through science and technology.
Let's connect!
